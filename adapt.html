        <h1>Retelling Folklore</h1>
        <p>Since most folklore started out as oral storytelling, it is no wonder that these tales morphed and shifted from every location and culture they passed along to. New authors and cultures adapting and tweaking these stories is a practice true to the oral traditions of folklore. Whether you are reading the story as written down, adding new visual elements, or even creating a new story from the bones of a folktale, you are taking part of the beautiful cycle of folklore.</p>

        <h1>"The Originals were Darker!"</h1>
        <p>When bringing up various adaptations of folktales, particularly children's versions, you might hear someone say this. Some may point to perhaps the most famous folklore adaptations, the Disney animated versions of fairytales such as Cinderella, Snow White, etc. and claim that they were ruined through "Disneyfication". Though Disney did not start this trend, it is definitely the example that people point to when talking about this subject. Many older versions of these tales often included darker subject matter such as violence, sexual content, or taboo subjects. For instance, in the Grimm version of Cinderella, the stepsisters cut off parts of their feet to fit into the all-important shoe. I think that it's important to remember that changes in adaptation are very normal and not inherently wrong. Famous folklore collectors such as the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson all changed details and concepts from the oral folklore they were collecting. I don't think it's wrong to prefer the darker or lighter versions- it's all part of the ongoing growth of these stories.</p>
