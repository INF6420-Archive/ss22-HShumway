# INF6420 Project Hannah Shumway

A site serving as a brief introduction to folklore.

## Wireframes

These are some basic layouts of how the website will hopefully look upon completion. 

![Wireframe of Home Page] (wireframes\wireframehome.jpg)

Header- This will serve as the site banner which will feature my own graphics.

Navigation Bar- this will include links for the home page as well as the other two main pages I'm planning.

Main content- each of the content on the pages will differ, but will feature different styles such as embed videos, lists, etc.

Footer- will include a few additional links, back to home, contact information, and any necessary copyright info.
