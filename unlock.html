            <ul>
                <li>Folk literature does not have a true start date- the concept is as old as human society, as folklore consists of the oral tradition of humans conveying everything from stories to riddles and songs.</li>
                <li>In 1812, brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published their first collection of German fairytales (titled Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen). This begins the history of modern folklore studies.</li>
                <li>In the 20th century, folklorists would craft different ways to record and engage with folklore. Three folklorists would craft the ATU Index to further catalog different types of folklore, as writing down a definitive version of many of these tales is impossible.</li>

            <h1>ATU Index</h1>
            <p>The Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index (ATU Index), was created over decades by three folktale scholars who devised the system to help categorize folk tales from around the world. The first version, created by Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne in 1910, focused on strictly European folktales. In 1928 (with later revisions in 1961), American folklore scholar Stith Thompson built off of Aarne's work to expand the index from the German language to folktales in English and added a numbering system. The latest addition was by German folklorist Hans-Joerg Uther in 2004. He took the previous index and created the classification system used today, and expanded the scope of the tales to a more international scale- he felt that the earlier versions needed further refining and additions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The ATU index categorizes folktales through the different motifs and tale types often seen in these stories. While there are many ways to track and research folklore, this is one of the most prominent methods for cataloging folk tales today. Some tale type categories include animals, magic, realistic, and religious. Some motif examples (from the Thompson index) would be tests, the wise and the foolish, and society. There is still a large amount of tales and cultures that need better representation in the index- it is nowhere near complete yet! </p>
            <br>
            <p><u>Example:</u> Let's look at the French fairytale "Donkeyskin"- this tale is categorized at ATU 510B. 510 is the number for the Persecuted Heroine, while the letter B classifies "Donkeyskin" as the variant of 510 known as "unnatural love". By using the ATU index, we can see that "Donkeyskin" is not only related to the well-known story Cinderella (510A), but that it has many other related tales in 510B under different names/slightly different stories, i.e. Catskin, Mossycoat, Tattercoats, or Cap O' Rushes.
